# MineSweeper
My class inspired me to make this game! I wanted to implement this without looking up the game logic and just make this game by observing how the game actually works. I still need Google for some functions for Swift ðŸ¤”
## Progress
### Week 0
I have implemented the grid, and revealing algorithm for the grid correctly (using DFS), but I have not implemented the other functions yet, such as flagging and main game loop.
